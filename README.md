## 1. Background & Motivation

An elo system for my brother's jokes.

## 2. The Stack

I'll be building this application in the simplest way possible as I know I can easily distract myself with the nuances of different technologies, so to build this app I'll use the following tools: 

- React w/ React MUI
- Node.js
- Airtable (database)

## 3. To Do

The task is split into 3 features which will make up the MVP for this application. To start, I don't want to do anything too fancy with the app unless the core functionality is already implemented, so if I can get these features done I'll be pretty happy. 

### 3.1. Feature Set 1. Playing the Game
This focuses on the basic point of the app, to vote on the best jokes. 

#### 3.1.1. Select an option
 - [ ] User must be able to view two different jokes
 - [ ] If the form submission fails, a reasonable error message is shown
 - [ ] User must be able to select their preferred option
 - [ ] On selection, the ELO for their jokes is updated

#### 3.1.2. Rounds
 - [ ] User must be able to play a total of 10 rounds
 - [ ] User must be able to view the round they are on and the rounds they have left
 - [ ] User can view previous rounds for what they selected
 - [ ] User is given a run down of their selection after all 10 rounds
 
 
 #### 3.1.3. Leaderboards
 - [ ] A unique route should exist for this screen 
 - [ ] Leaderboards can be viewed at anytime for any user
 - [ ] After the 10 rounds, user should be shown the leaderboard
